You find that the drug has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $40,000/QALY (compared to a typical threshold of $50,000-$100,000 QALY) over a lifetime time horizon.  To provide the drug to the entire eligible population would cost about 20% of the current Medicaid budget over the next 3 years.
